  "prompt": "A boldly seductive Korean woman in her 20s standing alone under a bus stop shelter at night rain, intimate\ncinematic mood, framed from mid-torso to mid-thigh.\nPose: one hand gripping the vertical pole above shoulder height (stretch tension), hips angled forward, spine\nsubtly arched; the other hand lightly hooks a finger into the waistband of her high-waist denim shorts (or holds\na small tote strap close to her hip), deliberate tension without posing like a studio model.\nExpression: unwavering direct eye contact, slightly narrowed half-lidded eyes, soft parted lips, no smile, slow-\nbreath intensity—confident and commanding.\nOutfit: casual wet white cotton t-shirt (thin but not see-through), rain-soaked and clinging realistically with\ndarker wet patches, visible wet fabric tension lines, natural micro-wrinkles, heavier water weight; high-waist\ndenim shorts, matte texture. A few damp hair strands stick to her cheek/neck; tiny water droplets on fabric and\nskin; realistic skin texture with visible pores and subtle imperfections; avoid perfect symmetry.\nLighting: cool streetlight ambient + warm shop/window spill in the distance (mixed lighting), wet asphalt\nreflections, mild halation around streetlights, smooth highlight roll-off, no clipped highlights; soft shadow\ngradients.\nEnvironment: rain streaks and puddles, bus stop glass covered in raindrops, empty street background, shallow\ndepth of field; no readable signage or ads.\nCamera: 85mm, f/1.8, handheld candid documentary snapshot, shallow depth of field, slight natural motion\nrealism.\nFilm look: Kodak Portra 400, subtle grain, gentle vignette, smooth tonal transitions; no HDR, no hyper-clarity, no\nover-sharpening, no CGI look.\nExclude any readable text, signage, logos, posters, labels, watermarks; tasteful, non-explicit, no nudity, no\npornographic framing.",
